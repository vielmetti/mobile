mobile directory

this is a directory of web sites formatted
particularly well for mobile devices which
is to say the blackberry which is what i 
use as a mobile device.

the simplest version of this is a long list
of links; at some point the long list of links
should be turned into a data set that can be
reused for something.  but for now, links.
