## mobile directory (2015)

this is a directory of web sites formatted
particularly well for mobile devices which
is to say an Android phone which is what i 
use as a mobile device.

the simplest version of this was a long list
of links; at some point the long list of links
has been turned into a data set that can be
reused to build an app with jQuery Mobile.

files here:

* index.html - the application
* codiqa.ext.js - an empty place for more javascript
* codiqa.ext.css - an empty place for more CSS
* mobile.html - the original, 2008 version of this project
